## Introduction

Building Ava from Ex-Machina using Language model paired audio engine to generate speech along with a vision model capabale of understanding human emotions &  . Using MoE to generated and understand speech, and then using vision models to identify and see physical things.

Trained models can be downloaded from: [huggingface/ava-v1](https://huggingface.co/shivendrra/ava-v1)

## Audio-Language Model

A transformer based language MoE model fused with an audio engine, that could directly be trained on audio lanugage rather than on written data without even need of text data in any way. Still experimenting, will see what happens.

## Vision Model

Not yet decided, but I'll soon.
